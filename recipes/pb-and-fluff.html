    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I used to really like these back in the day. Don't think I could stomach one now, but you <strong>go
            ahead</strong>. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Salted Peanuts</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>the fluffiest Fluff you can get your hands on</li>
        <li>Oh and bread</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the peanuts in a jar.</li>
        <li>Stare off into middle distance; wonder what is the closest you've ever been to Gwyneth Paltrow, physically
            and/or spiritually.</li>
        <li>Take the peanuts out of the jar and press them <em>firmly</em> into the stick of butter.</li>
        <li>Start throwing fluff at the peanut-butterstick-sculpture <em>as haphazardly as possible</em>.</li>
        <li>Slice your bread and gingerly place it atop your fluffy masterpiece.</li>
        <li>Remark, <em>"Well isn't this the best thing since sliced bread?"</em> to the echoes of an empty room.</li>
    </ol>
